    "text": "The past decades have seen large calls for consideration of the sex dimension into research and clinical projects. However as we progress towards more frequent inclusion of this variable, the design of experiments evolved to be much more complex, in particular challenging the analysis steps.\nIn this hands-on session we would like to focus on a particular transcriptomic dataset where the sex variable was considered in addition to other variables of interest, and illustrate a differential expression analysis aiming at rigorously testing for sex differences and notably the presence of interactions between factors. Following on Frédéric’s presentation, we would like to use this hands-on to draw your attention at power issues potentially affecting conclusions, and how to best report results of your analyses.\nToday’s dataset is described in this paper “Tamoxifen induction of Cre recombinase does not cause long-lasting or sexually divergent responses in the CNS epigenome or transcriptome: implications for the design of aging studies”, and focuses on the potential side effects of Tamoxifen treatment, widely used to induce CreERT2 activity in transgenic mouse systems. Tamoxifen acts as an antagonist of estrogen receptor (ER), which could cause differences in response across sexes."
